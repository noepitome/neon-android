NEON
=======

NEON is currently a shitty re-skin of Vector, which is an Android Matrix client.
  		  

Watch this space.
 

Build instructions
==================

This client is a standard android studio project.

If you want to compile it in command line with gradle, go to the project directory:

Debug mode:

`./gradlew assembleDebug`

Release mode:

`./gradlew assembleRelease`

And it should build the project (you need to have the right android SDKs)

FAQ
===
